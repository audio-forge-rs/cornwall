Manage the context window.

This project will out live your current context window, how will future Claudes know what the heck is going on?

- CLAUDE.md - keep this file up to date
- MEMORY.md - in the ~/ user .claude directory or something
- auto compaction summaries

also CLAUDE.md can point to other md doc files.

and claudes do tend to find well named doc files.

and scripts! That is a more concrete way to encode workflows and procedures, a script with --help.

prefer scripts where the script takes an argument that is a command - that way there isn't a huge proliferation of scripts. It doesn't have to be just one script. But put related functionality in one script.
